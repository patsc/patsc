## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patrick and I am working as a senior scientist at ETH Zurich.

In my job, I am working on different, technology related aspects of cyber security. During my PhD I have worked on formal modelling of security protocols and the formal analysis of their security properties. After my PhD I have spent quite some time in industry and have worked in various security related positions (software engineer, security architect, etc.) before coming back to academia.

I am interested in all kind of information security related technical challenges.
